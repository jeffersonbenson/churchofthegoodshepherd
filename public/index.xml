      <description>We Are A Three Streams Church Church of the Good Shepherd in Lynchburg, Virginia is a Spirit-filled Anglican Church affiliated with the Anglican Church in North America (Diocese of the Mid-Atlantic).
We celebrate unity in the essential elements of Christian faith, worship, life and ministry. Like trees planted at the water’s edge, our Anglican roots are nourished by three streams: the Scripture, the Sacred and the Spirit.
 We hold that Scripture guides our lives and is authoritative for us individually and for the Church at large.</description>
