## We Are A Three Streams Church

Church of the Good Shepherd in Lynchburg, Virginia is a Spirit-filled Anglican Church affiliated with the Anglican Church in North America (Diocese of the Mid-Atlantic).

We celebrate unity in the essential elements of Christian faith, worship, life and ministry. Like trees planted at the water’s edge, our Anglican roots are nourished by three streams: the Scripture, the Sacred and the Spirit.

- We hold that Scripture guides our lives and is authoritative for us individually and for the Church at large.
- We believe the Sacred is embodied in the practices and teachings Christians have held throughout the centuries as expressed in the historic Creeds and 39 Articles of Religion. Our faith has many forms of worship including the sacraments instituted by Jesus.
- We trust God’s Spirit is at work in the Church and the world, manifesting His power and preparing us for ministry

These three streams flow from one source – the truth of our Christian witness as taught by Jesus and His apostles; and together, the Scripture, the Sacred and the Spirit form a river that defines our core values and distinctives; shapes our identity and guides our words, actions and worship.
